There are four files in this repository.  One is the data we used to train our model.  The three code files involve 
one containing our data work to get our training data,  one about our logistic regression work, and one that sort of 
simulates the tournament. The data and model work are pretty well commented and clear but our tournament simulation 
is a bit rougher and the outputs aren't as clear to an outward observer.  I thought I should include it anyway just 
so you had an idea what we did for that part.
